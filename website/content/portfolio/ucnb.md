UCNB is a helper application built to extend the Unifi Controller notifications by allowing more output methods other than eMail. In it core this is just an SMTP server with some logic to forward eMails to other resources. This was initially built to forward notifications to IFTTT so that they trigger notifications in a phone, but it is possible to use this project for many other purposes.
