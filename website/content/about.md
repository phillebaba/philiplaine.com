I'm Philip Laine currently living in Sweden working with IT consultancy. I love computers and writing software on my free time, using small projects as a reason to learn new skills. Right now my main programming languages are Golang and Python. A lot of my projects are related to IaC and Kubernetes, or applications that are meant to be run on the clusters that I build.
